    <p>He hacked the universe.<br/>The universe loved him for it.</p>

    <p>In 2079, the last great engineer stands on the brink of immortality. His mission? To rewrite the code of human consciousness—to strip away pain, optimize joy, and finally, upload himself into the quantum field that binds all existence.</p>

    <p>But the field has its own logic.</p>

    <p>As corporate warlords and mystic rebels battle to control reality’s fabric, a deeper truth emerges: Consciousness cannot be conquered. Only embraced.</p>

    <p>A visionary fusion of hard science fiction and cosmic romance, -1 is the story of the last mind to resist the universe... and the first to truly understand it. (<em>coming soon</em>)</p>

      <figcaption>Hubris</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The twenty-second century. Humanity basked in its gilded cage: equality enshrined, abundance unbound, the solar system thrumming with contentment. Martian cities glittered, lifespans stretched beyond reckoning—until the void exhaled the Qhennthyk. Silent, implacable, they offered no treaties. Only oblivion.</p>

    <p>Earth’s councils wavered: expose the terror and risk collapse, or bury the truth and doom billions? Defiance stirred in the shadows. Colonies cast desperate lotteries in the abyss. A question festered: What solace is paradise when the universe demands its tithe?</p>

    <p><em>Hubris</em> traces a brutal pilgrimage through shattered dreams, probing the last embers of hope in a world undone. When control unravels, what binds us? And is oblivion the final cost of Eden?</p>

      <figcaption>Dichotomies of Longing</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Beneath a sky stained blazing-fierce in Ishtar’s name, a priestess wagers her soul against a trader’s touch. A geisha’s whispered illusions cleave a samurai’s heart, leaving echoes of rusted honor. And in the coal-choked grip of Victorian London, an orphan’s stolen glance ignites forbidden embers within a master’s haunted grief.</p>

    <p>These are hymns to love’s jagged edges, wounds etched in the old tongues of honor and ruin. Oaths betrayed, alliances fractured, and souls reshaped in the crucible of silent rebellion. From sun-baked ziggurats to manors choked in gaslight, a question bleeds through: what lingers when devotion turns teeth-sharp defiance?</p>

    <p>No balm. No easy cartography of the heart. Just the visceral whispers of choices seared onto flesh. And the livid glint of hearts that won’t unclench, won’t beg for absolution.</p>

    <p>Embrace the ache. This is romance devoured alive. (<em>coming soon</em>)</p>
