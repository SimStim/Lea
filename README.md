# Lea: ePub anvil

Produce ePubs conforming to latest standards.
Support for many advanced features like semantics.
Easy to use.

## Planned features:

- semantic tagging
- proprietary xml tags
- text blocks (simple templating, using those xml tags)
- automated manifest (authors including: "file as," tagging of specific texts)
- automated spine
- automated table of contents (configurable via templating)
- automated inclusion of font files (from css definitions)
- EPUBchecker validation
- dry run
- independent of OS: developed on Fedora, but should run on Ubunto without any problems
- others I can't remember right now

The output is supposed to be opened in Sigil. You should check the report cards and make sure everything is queaky clean.
Don't forget to prettify, because Lea only works for paranoiacs!

## Launch timing of 1.0.0

Semantically defined as: Lea creates an ePub identical to one I have previously produced manually (except for the useless stuff that Sigil inserts sometimes, like the bookmarks file).

## Next kilometer stone:

0.0.2: Initial code commit after setting up VSCodium

## Previous kilometer stones:

0.0.1: Figure out this new personal access token bs

0.0.0: We gaze into that void, hearts bared to its depths, and in our longing stare ... something shifts. A stillness that aches like a farewell, as if our dreams summon a reply too vast for our fragile existence to bear.
