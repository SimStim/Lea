# 🝄 Lea EPUB Anvil

Lea produces EPUBs conforming to the latest standards, i.e., 3.3 at the time of writing.
Lea is not trying to be a full EPUB authoring environment, a semantic curator,
or a replacement for Sigil's editorial layer. Lea is a compiler, validator, and normalizer.
The output is intended to be opened in Sigil. Lea guarantees correctness,
human editors can add meaning later.

## Features

- filename and identifier consistency
- dynamic local cross-file link targets
- external link target validity check
- generation of EPUB manifest, including metadata and spine
- error messages with focused suggestions for fixes
- easy to learn and use if you know some XML or HTML
- Lea is a bitch, the female dog variant; you can always rely on her

### Existing

* filename and identifier consistency
* dynamic local cross-file link targets
* generation of EPUB OPF manifest
* generated EPUB is backwards-compatible with the EPUB2 standard
* support for book series collections with ISSN
* support for anthologies with per-text authors and rights
* support for text blocks
* support for the execution of pre-made scripts enabling handling of any edge cases like linked images
* <lea:> tags anywhere in the source files, for example, for images with captions
* validation of external links
* support for advanced typesetting: embedded fonts and stylesheets
* EPUBCheck validation
* command-line arguments for run-time configuration
* repo includes the world's very first, fully Lea-produced actually published title,
  compiling ~8 MB into a 3.3 MB EPUB file in 0.273 seconds on my Zen-2 based notebook

### Planned

* automatic detection and content-based compression of image files
* import of word processor documents into Lea definition files
* packaging of Lea definition files for archiving
* simple but useful reports
* important: throw error on unknown attributes instead of silently ignoring them.
* refactor for a new LeaTags class enabling case-insensitive cached XPath queries.
* new helper class NewPowerGeneration.
* Add a lea:index tag to define an index and a lea:script to produce the index.
* pipe every file access through Girlfriend for centralized error handling.
* check for the existence of extensions before using them, e.g., curl.
* time-frame: import of word processor files and image manipulations before 2Q2026.

## 1.0.0 and ⊙

🝄 stands for Lea as a holistic entity. The glyph ⊙ was chosen as a marker for specific aspects
at defined points in time. If 🝄 is the flux for soldering, then ⊙ is the moment when
the soldering iron heats the flux and a new creation emerges.

⊙ expresses a structured combination where the structure matters more than the operands.
It is not about symmetry but coherence. ⊙ marks the point around which a meaning is calibrated.
Lea's process is information-preserving normalization, or a lossless canonicalization.

With the release of "⊙ 1.0.0," Lea will be able to dynamically create an EPUB
from config and content files only.

Releases marked with ⊙ are recommended for most users. These releases will be stable,
have long-term support, and will come with major new features.

## Kilometer stones

1.0.9

* An optional title attribute was added to lea:chapter and lea:section.
* Grammar is locked in until the next release.

1.0.8

* Fixed the skip attribute; it was not filtering correctly.

* The lea:defaultcaption tag is an option now (TOFKAD: "the option formerly known as defaultcaption").
* Added an Essentials edition to the repo, check out the minimal differences between the config files.
* Method for rewrapping DOM had stylesheet.css hard-coded; fixed.
* Added ncx generation for EPUB2-compatibility: guide and ncx generators, and ncx template file.
* Added default values to Girlfriend's memory.
* Changed behavior: images linked from stylesheets are always loaded from the stylesheet folder now.
* Added regex to the skip attribute because you can't have enough brain damage.
* Added transliteration map to the strToEpub* functions; the things you do for Philip José Farmer!
* Changed grammar to allow child nodes inside captions for formatting them.
* Changed the check-links command-line option to check-urls for elevated semantic accuracy.

1.0.7

* Fixed disregard of the optional "to" attribute when validating URLs.
* Visual change: Lea ePub anvil ⇒ Lea EPUB Anvil; seems to be more visually balanced.
* Refactoring, and a lot of small fixes addressing grammar changes.
* This version is not a full release, but the grammar should be close to stable at this point.

1.0.6

* Added new tags for chapter and section headings.

1.0.5

* Added a third option to the lea:subfolder tag for the EPUB output folder.

* Scripts are processed first now, so that they can output blocks; useful for dynamic lists.
* Added a script to iterate over all authors and include text blocks based on their names.
* Girlfriend's readFile is not case-sensitive anymore on Linux; she'll still complain.
* Changed script execution to work on ebook config files; handy for some dc tag automation.

1.0.4

* Grammar changes to simplify tags and their usage.
* Fixed metadata error: multiple authors for a text produced a wrong identifier for any author beyond the first.
* Added spinner animation to EPUBCheck validation.
* Fixed an exception when checking external links with an empty list of URLs.
* Checking external URLs doesn't hammer the CPU anymore, thanks to usleep.
* The lea:subfolder tag can now discriminate between text and images via an added attribute.

a confident attitude (Push) Believe me, you will get busy"

* Modified README.md to clarify the glyphs.
